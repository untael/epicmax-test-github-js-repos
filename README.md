## Task
Develop a small app that shows a list of all JavaScript repos on Github, sorted by number of stars.

## Requirements:
* List’s columns: name, url (link), owner, forks, open issues, watchers. 
* Should have pagination on scroll.
* Should show loader when data is being loaded. 
* Should look nice and have some styling.
* Please, store sources in a public repo (bitbucket, **github**, gitlab).
* Have a live version of an app deployed via netlify

Note:
* You can use GitHub API for that (https://api.github.com)
* Use Vue.js. Any flavor you’re comfortable with (**ts**, jsx, **scss**, scoped, **bem**, etc).
* You can use any other libraries (but no UI libries like Vuetify/Element/Material as we want to see custom styling).
* We expect you to do this at first attempt and spend no more than 4 hours.
